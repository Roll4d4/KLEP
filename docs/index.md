KLEP (Key-Lock Executable Process) is a groundbreaking symbolic AI system.

## How to Use This Page

This is the official landing page for **KLEP**, a symbolic AI framework inspired by human cognition and designed to mimic human decision-making through symbolic logic.  

If fully realized, KLEP aims to simulate thought processes and decision-making like humans. Failing that, it will stand as a robust logical framework for use in systems and games.

Below, youâ€™ll find sections detailing the various parts of KLEP. Each section has a flag indicating its status:

<div style="border: 1px solid #444; background-color: #000; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px; color: #fff;">
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸŸ¢ <strong>Green</strong>: Tested and fully functional.</li>
    <li>ðŸŸ¡ <strong>Yellow</strong>: Code exists but requires more testing.</li>
    <li>ðŸ”´ <strong>Red</strong>: Theoretical; no code yet.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### About This Page

This page explores the **philosophical** and **conceptual** aspects of KLEP, the foundations that inspire its logic, and the reflections on what it means to be a "thinking machine." This can be thought of as the **humanities side** of the projectâ€”an examination of the deeper questions behind the system.

Meanwhile, the **project page** focuses on the **practical implementation** of these ideas through code. This dual approach allows us to bridge theory and application, addressing both the "why" and the "how" of KLEP.

### Why Unity and C#?

I believe that we **find ourselves through play**, and so the code presented here is geared toward the Unity engine, written in C#. This choice reflects the intent to make KLEP not only an AI framework but also a tool for creativity, experimentation, and exploration. However, the concepts and logic behind KLEP are universal, making it applicable to any system requiring decision-making as agile as humans.

## The Components of KLEP

### Neuron ðŸŸ¢
The foundational unit of KLEP. Neurons handle the management of keys, locks, and executables.

Key (ðŸŸ¢)

View Key Details

    Symbolic Property Management (ðŸŸ¢): Handles a set of properties representing various attributes of the Key, ensuring flexible and extensible data handling.
    Loader Integration (ðŸŸ¢): Synchronizes Key properties with a keyLoader resource, providing dynamic initialization and updates based on predefined defaults.
    Attractiveness and Prioritization (ðŸŸ¢): Incorporates "attractiveness" as a factor that can guide decision-making and sorting, aiding systems that must select among multiple keys.
    Runtime Property Adjustments (ðŸŸ¢): Allows adding, removing, and resetting properties at runtime, facilitating dynamic changes in logic and behavior.
    Seamless Lock Integration (ðŸŸ¢): Designed to fit into the Keyâ†’Lock pipeline, ensuring easy validation and control flow when passing Keys through Locks and Executables.

### Lock ðŸŸ¢
Locks validate keys and control access to executables, ensuring proper sequencing in symbolic logic.

### Agent ðŸŸ¢
The decision-making layer that interacts with neurons and controls higher-order logic.

### Ethical and Emotional Layers ðŸŸ¡
A developing system to simulate ethical reasoning and emotional states.

### Memory ðŸŸ¡
A memory layer to retain information and guide decision-making over time.

### Angles and Demons ðŸŸ¡
A conceptual layer exploring different perspectives (angles) and biases (demons) in decision-making.

### The Trainyard ðŸŸ¢
A simulation tool used to test and debug the interactions between keys, locks, and agents.

### Theoretical Layers ðŸ”´
Conceptual components (like creativity) that have no implemented code but provide a roadmap for future exploration.
