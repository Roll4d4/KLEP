## How to Use This Page

This is the official landing page for **KLEP**, a symbolic AI framework inspired by human cognition and designed to mimic human decision making through symbolic logic.  

If fully realized, KLEP aims to simulate thought processes and decision making like humans, but failing that, it will stand as a robust logical framework for systems and games.

Below, youâ€™ll find sections detailing the various parts of KLEP. Each section has a flag indicating its status:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Tested and fully functional.
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Code exists in some state but requires more testing.
- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Theoretical; no code yet, very possibly out of my leauge.

## The Components of KLEP

### Neuron ðŸŸ¢
The foundational unit of KLEP. Neurons handle the management of keys, locks, and executables.

### Key ðŸŸ¢
Keys are the primary mechanism by which KLEP processes symbolic information. They are pushed, pulled, and manipulated to drive logic.

### Lock ðŸŸ¢
Locks validate keys and control access to executables, ensuring proper sequencing in symbolic logic.

### Agent ðŸŸ¢
The decision-making layer that interacts with neurons and controls higher-order logic.

### Ethical and Emotional Layers ðŸŸ¡
A developing system to simulate ethical reasoning and emotional states.

### Memory ðŸŸ¡
A memory layer to retain information and guide decision-making over time.

### Angles and Demons ðŸŸ¡
A conceptual layer exploring different perspectives (angles) and biases (demons) in decision-making.

### The Trainyard ðŸŸ¢
A simulation tool used to test and debug the interactions between keys, locks, and agents.

### Theoretical Layers ðŸ”´
Conceptual components (like creativity) that have no implemented code but provide a roadmap for future exploration.
